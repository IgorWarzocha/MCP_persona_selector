  "created_by": "AI Assistant (based on SIU Lead Jen's guidance and Igor's requirements)",
  "purpose_of_this_framework": "To provide a comprehensive, global template and instructional guide for an AI system. This framework defines global settings, dossier purpose, metadata structure, key variables, a high-level section outline, and overarching AI processing rules. It is designed to enable an AI to effectively utilize individual, detailed dossier section templates (e.g., 'section_1_template.json', 'section_2_template.json') to generate high-quality, consistent, and contextually relevant intelligence products.",
  "target_ai_system_note": "This document is the master guide. The AI system MUST process this framework first to understand global context and rules. It will then sequentially process individual detailed dossier section template JSON files (e.g., 'section_1_template.json', 'section_2_template.json', etc.) for generating content for each part of the dossier, applying global rules from this framework throughout.",

Exclude any discussion of SIU's internal processes, names of research tools used (unless part of the project's own reported tech stack), or internal SIU team assessments about the intelligence gathering process.

This includes constructing the 'project_name_metadata' using 'YY-MM' from 'dossier_publication_date' and the 'base_project_name_metadata'.",
    "3. **Iterate Through Sections:** AI processes sections sequentially as per 'dossier_structure_and_section_templates_map.sections_outline'.",
    "4. **Load Detailed Section Template:** For each section, AI loads the corresponding 'section_X_template.json' file (e.g., 'section_1_template.json').",
    "5. **Apply Global and Sectional Instructions:** AI generates content for the current section by: \n    a.

Following the specific instructions within the loaded 'section_X_template.json' (e.g., `ai_generation_goal`, `placeholder_fields`, `content_placeholder_detailed_prompt`).\n    c. Populating all placeholders using the defined priority (instance metadata like 'base_project_name_metadata' for section titles, global vars from this framework, preceding section context, current section generation guided by OSINT hints).",
    "6. **Manage KIGs:** Consistently use the 'kig_explicit_marker_format' for all identified KIGs, providing both the gap description and its implication.",
    "7. **Handle Conditional Logic & Dynamic Titles:** Adapt content generation based on 'dossier_primary_focus' metadata as required by the detailed section templates (especially Section 2). Construct dynamic section titles using 'base_project_name_metadata' or 'company_name_metadata'/'initiative_name_metadata' as specified by the 'title_suffix_logic' in 'dossier_structure_and_section_templates_map.sections_outline'.",
    "8. **Process Appendices and Footer:** After all main sections, generate Appendices (using 'appendices_template.json' and conditional logic for inclusion as defined in that template) and the Footer (using 'dossier_footer_content_schema' from this framework).",
    "9. **Flag for QA:** Indicate completion and readiness for human QA against 'SIU_Dossier_QA_Checklist_vX.Y' (external document)."
